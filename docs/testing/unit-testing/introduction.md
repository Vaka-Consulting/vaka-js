# Unit Testing

Unit testing is important to see if any funtionality breaks after changing code.
This way we can test the most important features of our website and make sure nothing breaks.
A good example of why to write unit tests is a calculator.
If you do the folowing math: `1 + 3` we'd expect the outcome to be `4`.

With writing unit tests we test our code and make sure the outcome doesn't change for thie scenario when updating the code.
It also gives us more confidence before releasing.
